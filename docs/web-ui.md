# Accessing the UI

### Default UI

You can access the default UI or any custom UI with the following url from you local host. Just make sure that the exposed port is 8080.

```
http://<local-ip>:8080
```

For username and password check the env variables `QBITTORRENT_USERNAME` and `QBITTORRENT_PASSWORD` or you can set your own while starting the container.
